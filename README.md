# Capstone Project

This is my Senior Capstone Project at CSU, Chico. Eventually, it will have a name.

The project will allow a user to link their Spotify account, type an idea for a playlist, and have an AI generated playlist using that idea added to their account automatically.

Two environment variables must be set for the frontend and backend to connect: REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL and REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL. These should be set to the URL of the backend and frontend respectively, including 'http://' and the port number.
